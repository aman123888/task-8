# AirBNB-Final-Project
This project presents a comprehensive analysis of a cleaned Airbnb dataset, covering over 55,000 listings across major cities. The goal was to uncover patterns that can help improve business decisions and enhance the guest experience. Key features analyzed include property type, room type, pricing, host response behavior, cancellation policies, number of reviews, and geographic distribution.

Our analysis revealed strong demand for entire homes and real beds, with apartments being the most listed property type. High host response rates and a significant portion of listings priced under $100 point to an emphasis on affordability and trust. We also found that instant booking and well-reviewed listings drive higher engagement.

This interactive report provides 40 key insights and 6 summarized conclusions to support strategic decision-making, improve occupancy rates, and guide host onboarding and pricing strategies. It is ideal for business stakeholders, marketers, or data enthusiasts looking to optimize Airbnbâ€™s operational performance.
